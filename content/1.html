    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I'm quitting my job. I work as a backend software engineer at a small-ish tech company. I make around 100k a year, have excellent benefits (going to Disneyland once a year), and love my coworkers. There is no problem with any aspect of my employment. I love my job. It's consistent, manageable, and in my head, it's a respectable career. It's such a good feeling telling someone that I'm a programmer working for a tech company and seeing their reaction. It's not for show, but most people are impressed. </p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;So why quit? Many things have changed throughout the 26 years of my life, but one thing has stayed consistent. I've always wanted to be rich. When I was younger, it was: 15 fast cars in my garage, a huge movie room, and a bowling alley (I don't even like bowling that much). Now those things aren't as enticing. I've realized now that the thing that is more valuable than all is freedomâ€”choosing where I work and when I work. Deciding what I work on and who I work with. I don't want to be told what a company's values are. I want to live them. So yes, I still want to be rich, but now I have more profound, pure, underlying motivations to help me get there. </p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;I've been working as a software engineer for around four years now. I've learned so much. I'm much more skilled and understand the industry like a pro. That's about it, though. From that growth and knowledge, I haven't had anything to show for it that's mine. It's all been someone else's. Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful that my company took a chance on me (I dropped out of college with little coding experience), but something still needs to change. I need to quit my job if I'm going to one day live the life that I dreamed of when I was 12 years old.</p>
    <p>&emsp;&emsp;To be clear, I haven't quit my job yet. There are a few pre-qualifications my business partner and I decide to "leap." Either 1. We are making 30k a month in our side business or 2. It's the end of the year. Even if I haven't made a dollar by the end of the year, I will still be quitting my job. It's scary to think about, but at that point, if I'm not making any money on my own, I'll need the motivation anyway.</p>
